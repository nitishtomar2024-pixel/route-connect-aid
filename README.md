   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Mapbox (Required for maps)**
   - Sign up for a free account at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
   - Get your public access token from the dashboard
   - Replace `'pk.YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE'` in `src/components/TransportMap.tsx` with your actual token

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The app will reload automatically as you make changes

## üì± App Structure

### Main Components

- **Dashboard**: Home screen with nearby buses and quick actions
- **TransportMap**: Interactive map with real-time bus locations
- **BusCard**: Individual bus information with tracking options
- **SearchBar**: Route planning with auto-suggestions
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar optimized for mobile
- **Profile**: User account and trip history

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Tracking**: Mock data simulation with live updates
2. **Map Integration**: Mapbox GL JS with custom markers and popups
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch optimization
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design with rural user considerations
5. **Transport Branding**: Color-coded routes and transport types

## üéØ For Rural/Semi-Urban Users

The app is specifically designed with rural communities in mind:

- **Icon-Driven Interface**: Visual icons alongside text for low-literacy users
- **Simple Navigation**: Clear, predictable navigation patterns
- **High Contrast**: Easy to read in various lighting conditions
- **Offline Fallback**: Graceful degradation for poor connectivity (ready for implementation)

## üîß Customization

### Adding Real Backend Integration

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Update bus data sources in components
2. **API Integration**: Connect to your transport API endpoints
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live data
4. **Authentication**: Add phone number OTP login system
5. **Database**: Connect to your preferred database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

### Extending Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Add i18n for regional languages
- **Offline Mode**: Implement service workers for cached data
- **Push Notifications**: Add arrival alerts and service updates
- **Payment Integration**: Connect to payment gateways for ticketing

## üåü Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Development**: 
   - Set up Node.js/Express or Django REST API
   - Implement real-time GPS tracking
   - Add user authentication and data persistence

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - WebSocket connections for live updates
   - Push notification system
   - Offline data caching
   - Multi-language support

3. **Mobile App**:
   - Convert to React Native for native mobile app
   - Add device-specific features (GPS, notifications)

## üìñ API Documentation

The app is structured to easily integrate with REST APIs:

```typescript
// Example API endpoints expected:
GET /api/buses/nearby?lat=28.6139&lng=77.2090
GET /api/routes/search?from=location1&to=location2
GET /api/buses/:id/track
POST /api/auth/login
GET /api/user/profile
```

## ü§ù Contributing

This codebase is designed for extensibility. Key areas for contribution:

- **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual transport APIs
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Further enhance rural user experience
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and offline capabilities
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
